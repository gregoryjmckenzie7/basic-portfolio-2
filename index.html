      <p>I am Gregory Mckenzie, I am 30 years old and live in Durham, NC. I recently quit my job at the United States Postal Service to pursue a career in developing and designing websites. I enrolled in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's coding boot camp. I am excited to learn everything that I can about website development.</p>

      <p2>My previous work experience includes elite level customer service at one of the most prestigious country clubs in North Carolina. I did everything from banquet server to managing a beverage operation that had an annual revenue of over one million dollars.<p2>
